Ques 1:- what is default and static method in java 8 and what is the difference between them. Can we create more than
one default and static methods in interface?
Ans :-
Default method :- Java 8 provides a facility to create default methods inside the interface. Methods which are defined
inside the interface and tagged with default are known as default methods. These methods are non-abstract methods.

Static method :- Like default methods interface allows adding static methods to it. We can define static methods inside
the interface using the static keyword and are used to define utility methods.

Difference :- 1.Default method can be overridden by its implementation classes if they required. Static method never be
overridden by its implementaion classes.
2.For accessing default method we need to create object of its implemented classes and for static method we can call by
interface name bcoz it static belongs to class level.

Can we create more than one default and static methods in interface : Yes


Ques 2:- Abstract class vs Java 8 interface?
Ans :- abstract class: Inside abstract class we can declare instance variables, which are required to the child class

       Interface: Inside interface every variables is always public static and final we cannot declare instance variables

       abstract class: Abstract class can talk about state of object

       Interface: Interface can never talk about state of object

       abstract class: Inside Abstract class we can declare constructors

       Interface: Inside interface we cannot declare constructors as purpose of
       constructors is to initialize instance variables. So what is the need of constructor there if we cannot have
       instance variables in interfaces.

       abstract class: Inside abstract class we can declare instance and static blocks

       Interface: Interfaces cannot have instance and static blocks.

       abstract class: Abstract class cannot refer lambda expression

       Interfaces: Interfaces with single abstract method can refer lambda expression

       abstract class: Inside abstract class we can override OBJECT CLASS methods

       Interfaces: We cannot override OBJECT CLASS methods inside interfaces.

       I will end on the note that:
       Default method concepts/static method concepts in interface came just to save implementation classes but not to
       provide meaningful useful implementation. Default methods/static methods are kind of dummy implementation,
       "if you want you can use them or you can override them (in case of default methods) in implementation class"
       Thus saving us from implementing new methods in implementation classes whenever new methods in interfaces are
       added. Therefore interfaces can never be equal to abstract classes.
