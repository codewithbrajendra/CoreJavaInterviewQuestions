Ques 1:- what is default and static method in java 8 and what is the difference between them?
Ans :-
Default method :- Java 8 provides a facility to create default methods inside the interface. Methods which are defined
inside the interface and tagged with default are known as default methods. These methods are non-abstract methods.

Static method :- Like default methods interface allows adding static methods to it. We can define static methods inside
the interface using the static keyword and are used to define utility methods.

Difference :- 1.Default method can be overridden by its implementation classes if they required. Static method never be
overridden by its implementaion classes.
2.For accessing default method we need to create object of its implemented classes and for static method we can call by
interface name bcoz it static belongs to class level.
